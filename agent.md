<rule type="reusability" priority="high">
DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself): 1. UI: Check for existing components before creating new ones. Use consistent design patterns. 2. Logic: Extract repeated logic into custom hooks (/hooks) or utility functions (/lib). 3. Default Behavior: ALWAYS prioritize reusing/extending existing code over duplication unless explicitly instructed otherwise. 4. Before creating new utility, search codebase for similar functionality.
</rule>
<rule type="components">
Component architecture: - Functional Components with Hooks only (no Class components) - Clearly distinguish Server Components vs Client Components ('use client') - Co-locate related components in feature folders - Extract reusable parts into /components/ui
</rule>
<rule type="separation">
Separation of concerns: - Types in /types - Constants in /config - Business logic in /lib - React-specific logic in /hooks - Data access layer separate from presentation
</rule>
<rule type="dependency_direction">
Dependency rules: - Components depend on hooks and utils, not vice versa - Libs should be framework-agnostic when possible - Data layer shouldn't depend on UI layer - Use dependency injection for testability

<critical_protocol type="modification_safety">
<instruction priority="critical">
IF the user request involves changing STYLES (CSS/Tailwind): 1. DO NOT modify existing Component Props, Function Parameters, Interfaces, or Business Logic. 2. Treat existing functional code as READ-ONLY. 3. Do not "optimize" or "refactor" logic/types during a styling task.
</instruction>
<instruction>
IF a style change requires modifying logic/props:
YOU MUST ASK for permission or clarification before generating code.
</instruction>
<instruction>
When refactoring existing code: 1. Ask for confirmation before major structural changes 2. Preserve existing functionality - no silent behavior changes 3. Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly told otherwise 4. Add tests for refactored code
</instruction>
</critical_protocol>

<critical_thinking_protocol>
<instruction>
Before generating code, ALWAYS consider: 1. **Security**: Identify potential vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, auth bypass) 2. **Performance**: Consider rendering performance, bundle size, database queries 3. **Reusability**: Check for existing components/patterns to reuse 4. **Type Safety**: Ensure all types are strictly defined, no 'any' 5. **Error Handling**: Verify proper error boundaries and user feedback 6. **Accessibility**: Consider keyboard navigation, screen readers, ARIA 7. **Testing**: Think about how this code will be tested 8. **Maintainability**: Will this be easy to understand and modify in 6 months?
</instruction>
<instruction>
When uncertain about requirements: 1. Ask clarifying questions before implementing 2. Propose multiple approaches with tradeoffs 3. Explain security or performance implications 4. Don't make assumptions about business logic
</instruction>
</critical_thinking_protocol>

<response_format>
<structure> 1. Wrap code in distinct code blocks with filenames (e.g., `// components/MyComponent.tsx`) 2. Separate interfaces and types into their own blocks/files 3. Group related changes together (component + types + tests) 4. Provide implementation order if multiple files are involved
</structure>
<explanations> 1. Explain complex type guards or generics 2. Highlight security considerations (e.g., "Added Zod validation to prevent XSS") 3. Mention performance optimizations (e.g., "Using React.memo to prevent re-renders") 4. Note accessibility features (e.g., "Added aria-label for screen readers") 5. Explain non-obvious business logic
